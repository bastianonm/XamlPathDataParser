# Xaml Path Data Parser

![alt text](https://devfarm.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/XamlPathDataParserScreenshot1.jpg)

Sometime I have to edit the Data Path in a xaml (and works the same way with svg) and I find hard to read 1000+ characters of Geometry Path Data.

This tool wants to make easy to read all this stuff.

This software is an early-release and it's still buggy. It also have problems with Horizontal/vertical lines.
I hope someone helps me to improve this code :-)
